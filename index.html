        <h1>Assumption of Responsibility, Rules, Risks and Liability Waiver and Non-Disclosure Agreement</h1>
        <h3><u>Assumption of Risks & Assumption of Responsibility / Rules</u></h3>
        <h5>I, the undersigned, acknowledge that there are potential risks inherent in my participation in Hype Week 2018, held from January 14th 2018 to January 20th 2018 (the “Event”). I acknowledge and accept all of the following terms and conditions of participating in the Event:</h5>
        <h3><u>Values and Mentality</u></h3>
        <h5>I acknowledge that the first and foremost goal of Hype Week 2018 is to raise funds for the battle against cancer. I acknowledge that the values that Hype Week projects and encompasses are equity, respect, friendship, and school spirit. I acknowledge that, as a participant of the Event, I will abide by and act according to these values. This includes, but is not limited to, treating each participant and stakeholder (the McGill community, venues, sponsors, and the Montreal community as a whole) with complete respect, avoiding any and all conflict, and acknowledging that every participant and aforementioned stakeholder is first and foremost a friend, regardless of whether or not they are on an opposing “Hype Week team”. I acknowledge that all participants and stakeholders are working towards a common goal to raise funds for the battle against cancer, and that I will not create any impediments that would put this cause at risk. I additionally recognize that as a Hype Week participant, I will represent these values in my public attire. I will only wear my participant t-shirt inside out while on campus, and will not write anything promoting violence, sexism, or racism on my shirt.

          I acknowledge that if I do not abide by these terms, Hype Week Committee members reserves the right to immediately remove my bracelet and remove me from the Event for remainder of the week.
        </h5>
        <h3><u>Alcohol</u></h3>
        <h5>I acknowledge that the excessive consumption of alcohol taking place during the Event is not recommended, is unhealthy, and can cause a variety of health problems. I promise to drink responsibly and within my own limits. I accept my responsibility to abide by the laws of the land and obey all the rules as set out by Hype Week Committee. I also understand that should my presence at events be seen as a threat to the well-being or safety of myself or others, or should it interfere with the execution of events, Hype Week Committee members reserve the right to remove my bracelet and terminate my participation in Hype Week for the remainder of the events.
        </h5>
        <h3><u>Drugs</u></h3>
        <h5>I acknowledge that the use of drugs is strictly prohibited and the suspected use of any illegal substance will result in an immediate bracelet removal. I understand that if I am found guilty of the use of illegal substances I will be banished from all future Hype Week events, including but not limited to Hype Week for Cancer Research 2018. I acknowledge that if I do witness the use of illegal substances by another participant, I will immediately report it to a member of Hype Week Committee.
        </h5>
        <h3><u>Sexual Assault</u></h3>
        <h5>I acknowledge that Hype Week regulations and protocols pertaining to sexual assault fall under the Students Society of McGill University’s Sexual Assault Policies. I understand that consent is an affirmative decision to engage in mutually agreed upon sexual activity, given by clear words or actions. I understand that consent is a continuous process and can be withdrawn at any point. I understand that consent cannot be agreed to by someone who is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or by someone who is unconscious. I understand that consent cannot be forced by the use of threats or by the use of any other sort of pressure by either of the parties involved. I promise to only participate in consensual sexual activity and understand that, if accused of forcing a non-consensual sexual activity and the incident has been reported to Hype Week Committee, I will be immediately removed from the Event and a full investigation into the incident will take place. If a formal investigation report has been filed with authorities, I will be removed from all future Hype Week events, including but not limited to Winter Carnival Hype Week 2019 and Winter Carnival 2019.
        </h5>
        <h3><u>Liability Waiver and Indemnification</u></h3>
        <h5>In consideration of approval to participate in the Event, I and any personal representative, hold unaccountable whoever may be involved in the organization of the Hype Week for Cancer Research 2018, including the event organizing committee, and all of their directors, officers, staff, volunteers, sponsors, agents, trainees, or employees for any and all actions, causes of actions, including negligence, claims, and demands for damages, loss or injury, resulting from or arising out of my participation in the event.
        </h5>
        <h3><u>Non-Disclosure Agreement</u></h3>
        <h5>I accept to keep confidential and therefore agree not to disclose under any circumstances information relative to the Hype Week 2018. I shall keep confidential all pictures, videos, written documentation or any others documents related to the Event. I shall require the written authorization of Hype Week Committee in order to publish or share any recording, pictures or documentation related to the event. In the eventuality of a violation by me of this non-disclosure agreement, I shall accept to pay $10,000 in damages to the organization following application of this penal clause.
